## 🛠️ The Tech That Makes It Flow

### 🌟 Frontend: Where User Experience Meets Performance

- **Next.js**: Lightning-fast React framework with SSR and SSG for a snappy, SEO-friendly interface.
- **React**: Component-driven UI library at the heart of TaskFlow.
- **AWS Amplify**: Automatically builds and globally delivers the Next.js app with blazing speed.

### 🧠 Backend: The Brains Behind the Operations

- **Node.js**: High-performance JavaScript runtime for handling API logic.
- **Amazon EC2**: Reliable cloud-based servers hosting the backend.
- **Amazon API Gateway**: Manages and routes API traffic securely.
- **AWS Lambda**: Executes event-driven tasks on the fly (e.g., user sign-up triggers).

### 🗄️ Database: Your Data, Structured and Secure

- **PostgreSQL**: Rock-solid relational database for storing tasks and user data.
- **Amazon RDS**: Manages backups, scaling, and security for PostgreSQL.
- *(Optional)* **Prisma**: Type-safe ORM for simplified database interaction.

### 🔒 Identity & Storage: Built for Trust and Scale

- **Amazon Cognito**: Manages secure user authentication and profiles.
- **Amazon S3**: Cloud storage for images and file attachments.

## 🚀 Get Started Locally & Ignite Your Flow!
Ready to see TaskFlow in action or contribute to its development? Here's how to set up your local environment:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have these tools installed:

- Git: To clone the project.
- Node.js (LTS): The JavaScript runtime and npm (or yarn).
- PostgreSQL: Your local database server.
- AWS CLI: Configured with your AWS credentials if you're interacting with live services like Cognito or S3 during local dev.

### Steps to Run TaskFlow:

1. **Clone the Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sivansrawat/TaskFlow.git
cd TaskFlow
```
(If you have separate frontend/backend repos, clone both.)

2. **Backend Setup*** (Node.js & PostgreSQL)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
3. **Create a PostgreSQL database and user:**

```sql
CREATE DATABASE taskflow_db;
CREATE USER taskflow_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_secure_password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE taskflow_db TO taskflow_user;
```
4. **Create a .env file in /backend:**

```env
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=taskflow_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
DB_NAME=taskflow_db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your_cognito_user_pool_id
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_cognito_client_id

```


5. **Run the Backend Server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Frontend Setup (Next.js)**

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install

```

7. **Create a .env.local file in /frontend:**

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_REGION=your_aws_region
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID=your_cognito_user_pool_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_COGNITO_CLIENT_ID=your_cognito_client_id
```
8 . **Run the Frontend Dev Server:**

```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit the app at http://localhost:3000 and start managing your tasks!
